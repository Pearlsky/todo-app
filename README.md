### Demo
- You can view the demo for for this to-do app [here](https://#)

### Experience
- When I started out with imagining how the logic for adding, ticking and deleting tasks should be, i imagined using array methods to flex. Turns out DOM Methods and their return values require a bit more care than assumption.

- I had just learnt about High Order Functions and I really wanted to explore that while building this app. But everytime I thought about the logic, a lot of it just lacked correlation. Eventually I settled for the MVC Pattern which I got introduced to while study Head First JS. I didn't know a lot about it, I still don't  know so much but it made code structure a bit more sensible and less voo-doo looking when i broke it down to model, view and controller roles.

- I could gush about all I learned building this app cos it really was fun (always) and very enlightening

### Learning & Improvements
- My debugging skills? I'm at a confident console.log debugging level, haha -- now I sound unserious
